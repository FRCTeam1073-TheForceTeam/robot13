#2013 Ultimate Ascent Robot Code

This is the code that runs on FIRST Team 1073's Ultimate Ascent --- **Ursa Minor!!!**

It uses an external repository that we wrote to provide for better global control of our hardware called `WPILibExtensions`.

To make sure that all submodules are obtained, and that fun stuff - run the following:

	#first time
	git submodule init
	#other times
	git submodule update
	#pulling latest branch, not always advised - generally the commit in .gitmodules is what you want
	cd WPILibExtensions
	git checkout master
	git pull

We'll be playing at the Granite State Regional in Manchester New Hampshire pretty soon - come check us out! And of course, best of luck to everyone out there in your competitions.
