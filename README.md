-2013 Ultimate Ascent Robot Code
-================================
-
-This is the code that runs on our robot for the 2013 FIRST Robotics Competition.
-
-Currently we will strictly enforce that all code changes be administered through robot builder!
-To avoid conflict in Robot Builder's poorly constructed configuration file please store code under
-	C:\Windriver\workspace by going into tools on the homepage of the github app and changing the default directory
-to C:\WindRiver\workspace.
-
-In order to run the Robot Code you need our Smart Dashboard Running, to configure this:
-
-	REM Windows Code
-	START GetDashboard.bat
-
-	#UNIX Code
-	bash GetDashboard.sh
-
-From there you need Java to run the program.
