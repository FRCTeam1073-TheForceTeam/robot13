#2013 Ultimate Ascent Robot Code

This is the code that runs on FIRST Team 1073's Ultimate Ascent --- **Ursa Minor!!!**

It uses an external repository that we wrote to provide for better global control of our hardware called `WPILibExtensions`.

To make sure that all submodules are obtained, and that fun stuff - run the following:

	#only need to do this on your first time
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

##Documentation
