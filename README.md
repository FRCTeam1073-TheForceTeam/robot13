2013 Ultimate Ascent Robot Code
================================

This is the code that runs on our robot for the 2013 FIRST Robotics Competition.

Currently we will strictly enforce that all code changes be administered through robot builder!
To avoid conflict in Robot Builder's poorly constructed configuration file please store code under
	C:\Windriver\workspace by going into tools on the homepage of the github app and changing the default directory
to C:\WindRiver\workspace. That change is required to be an active participant in the robot builder phase. See Evin or Greg for help.
